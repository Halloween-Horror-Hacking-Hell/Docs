- The result has to be written in [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and has to run on a Raspberry Pi 3
- The result will be presented for 5min on a big screen
- The result should be rendered in 1920 by 1080 pixels
- The result won't have access to any audio
- The result can't use any external scripts or graphics
- There will be a couple of technical rules about how to name files and alike but those will be announced in the future as well as how to 

In the end, every attendee can vote and the winner will take home a cool price.
