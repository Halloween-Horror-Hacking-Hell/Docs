<p>We&rsquo;re providing two different ways to attend the event. You can either join physically or digitally. Both spaces will be connected with a video stream. Read on to figure out how to participate.</p>
<h3 id="join-physically-on-location">Join Physically On Location</h3>
<p>The physical location will be in Sustrum Moor at <a href="http://lenny.farm">lenny.farm</a>. Click <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5VRgaEzkyajWLxW56">here</a> for detailed information on how to get there <strong>Important</strong> If you&rsquo;re planning to attend physically, we need you to sign up so we know how many people to expect. If you want to be there but your schedule doesn&rsquo;t allow for you to be there in the afternoon, you can of course join us later. Just let us know in the signup form as well as any food intolerances. We&rsquo;re going to close the <a href="https://forms.gle/SjC5aMMaB4BdKDd97">Signup Form</a> on the 20th of October at 11:59 pm.</p>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food and drinks aren&rsquo;t free and we don&rsquo;t want anyone to stay hungry. Please help us out by sending 5€ to the following PayPal account and adding <code>Halloween Horror Hacking Hell</code> as a message: <a href="https://paypal.me/tobiasboyer">https://paypal.me/tobiasboyer</a> Every penny will be appreciated, if you want to help us out by sending a bit more but it&rsquo;s <strong>completly optional!</strong>.</li>
<li>The main location will be a barn. Please make sure to bring a jacket as it might get cold in the evening.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll provide a WLAN connection and ports on one of our switches. If you want a LAN connection, bring a sufficiently long LAN cable.</li>
<li>Please, especially if you&rsquo;re bringing multiple devices, that require an outlet, bring a (safe!!) extension cable.</li>
<li>We might be able to organize a place for you to stay overnight. Please create an issue, so we can discuss the details. (See help section for more details on issues)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="join-our-virtual-space">Join Our Virtual Space</h3>
<p>Our virtual space will be open for anyone no binding sign up needed (the size of the virtual location is limited. If we&rsquo;re somehow above the limit, we&rsquo;ll provide access on a first come first serve bases but will prioritize people who signed up). All games and music will be streamed into the space. We&rsquo;ll be using &ldquo;VRChat&rdquo; as a meetup space. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/WtENuEbqUXk">here</a> for a guide on how to use the software. Hint: VRChat is freely available via Steam and can be used with a VR Headset and without.</p>
<p><strong>Here will be a link to the virtual space</strong></p>
<p>You can of course choose an avatar, that makes you happy. There are just a couple of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>No avatars that are rated poor or worse</li>
<li>No avatars that are offensive or not safe for work in any form</li>
<li>Nothing that would be against the VRChat terms of service</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hackaton">Hackaton</h2>
<p>The goal of the hackaton is to show how beautiful coding can be, by coding a visual animation in a limited environment with limited tools.</p>
<p>This results in the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>The result can be anything that fits with the theme (which will be announced on the day)</li>
<li>The result has to be written in <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> and has to run on a Raspberry Pi 3</li>
<li>The result will be presented for 5min on a big screen</li>
<li>The result should be rendered in 1920 by 1080 pixels</li>
<li>The result won&rsquo;t have access to any audio</li>
<li>The result can&rsquo;t use any external scripts or graphics</li>
<li>There will be a couple of technical rules about how to name files and alike but those will be announced in the future as well as how to</li>
